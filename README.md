# 🏆 COVID-19's Impact on Immigrant Populations in Minneapolis

This project explores how the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted immigrant communities in Minneapolis across key social determinants of health—such as housing, food access, employment, and mental health—through an intersectional lens of race and gender. The analysis uses data from the 2022 SHAPE (Survey of the Health of All the Population and the Environment) study by Hennepin County Public Health.

📌 **This project won First Place** in the **Data Analysis category** at the **2024 UMN Health Equity Data Challenge**, standing out among 46 participating teams.

## 📈 Project Overview

Using SHAPE 2022 survey data, this analysis investigates how the combined effects of race, gender, and immigration status shaped the pandemic experience for immigrant communities in Minneapolis. Key areas explored include:

- Food insecurity
- Housing instability
- Mental health outcomes
- Financial strain and job/income loss

Multiple logistic regression models was used to identify key predictors of food insecurity, revealing significant disparities.
